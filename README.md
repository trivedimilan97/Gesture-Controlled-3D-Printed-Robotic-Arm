# Gesture-Controlled-3D-Printed-Robotic-Arm
The robotic arm is controlled with the help of hand gestures which transmit signals to the robot through a device fixed on the hand gloves.
This project can be operated using multiple techniques, viz.
1) Wirelessly using nRF24L01 transceiver module.
2) In case facing troubles using the RF module, the output can be achieved with a wired mechanism.
3) The arm can also be controlled using a smartphone application via Bluetooth.
All 3 methods are provided, for more details read the 'Instructions' file in each folder. Have also attached the STL files for 3D printing the arm.
